# HumanitarianConnect
Overcome the barrier between everyday people and large humanitarian organizations. Implements algorithms that use specific characteristics of the donators and organizations for efficient matches,

# Purpose
We got inspired by the current Ukraine-Russia conflict and how many people are in need of humanitarian aid. Our project connects people who want to donate items to organizations that are willing to take the items to provide them to the people in need. 

# How to read
NewGUIApp file: Is the main file that opens the web app and depicts the graphics.
Database, Organization, and Donator: Classes that support the main GUI file. 
Images: Depicts how our web app looks like.
Diagram: Documents our thinking process.

# Software and Language
We used the java language and VSCode program to create classes and objects that support our GUI graphics and database of organizations.

# Challenges
We ran into technical problems related to using VSCodes. Additionally, we encountered language barriers and collaboration issues as all of our teammates are new hackers.

# Accomplishments
Our team was proud that we were able to apply the concepts learned in our school's AP Computer Science course to a program that can possibly be used by thousands.

# What's next
We plan to integrate machine learning to accept a wider range of data into our database as well as to apply computer vision aspects of the program that categorizes the objects of the image to the different types of donations.
